# UIB-sweety-layout

- Create a responsive page based on the screenshots using flex and media queries
- Take a look at the screenshots in the design folder

Note: 

- Use semantic tags for the various parts of your page (`header`, `main`, `nav`, `footer` etc.)
- The navigation should be always visible on all devices, no matter how much content is in the main section
- Menu links should have a deep pink underline by setting border-bottom to `a` elements on hover
- Icons should have a deep pink background on hover
- Extract the "Sweety" logo using gimp OR use some cool Google Fonts font :)
